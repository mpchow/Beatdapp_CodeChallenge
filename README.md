# Beatdapp_CodeChallenge

Submission for the Beatdapp coding challenge, built with React, Express, and MongoDB

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
1. Navigate to /BackEnd
2. Run "PORT=3001 npm start" for macOS or "set PORT=3001 && node bin/www" on windows 
3. Open a new terminal session
4. Navigate to /client
5. Run "npm start"
6. Go to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy!

## Notes
- The interface is a little finicky and may not update on add or remove, however a refresh of the page will fix it.
- The important code can be found in /BackEnd/routes/users.js and /client/src/App.js with /client/src/App.css for styling
